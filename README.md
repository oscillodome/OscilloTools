## FreqGate
**Frequency gate** for mono and stereo audio files up to **48kHz/24bit**.

The first tool is a Frequency Gate for mono files (it actually works with stereo files too, by summing the channels). You can think of it as a noise gate that works by letting pass through certain frequencies instead of the whole audio. You can select the minimum and maximum amplitude values in such a way that only the frequencies which amplitudes fit in that range are actually heard.

* Click & drag the pink slider to set the minimum and maximum amplitudes. 
* Shit+drag the minimum or maximum to thange this value only.
* Cmd+drag to drag the whole range.

This is a fork of a first approach of the tool made by [Sam Tarakajian](http://www.otherbirds.com/about) with [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max/).
