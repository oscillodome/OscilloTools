You can think of it as a noise gate that works by letting pass through certain frequencies instead of the whole audio. You can select the minimum and maximum amplitude values in such a way that only the frequencies which amplitudes fit in that range are actually heard.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oscillodome/OscilloTools/master/FreqGate.jpg)\r\n\r\n* Click & drag the pink slider to set the minimum and maximum amplitudes. \r\n* Shit+drag the minimum or maximum to thange this value only.\r\n* Cmd+drag to drag the whole range.\r\n\r\nTo download, head over to [my github repository](https://github.com/oscillodome/OscilloTools) or click the links above.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a fork of a first approach of the tool made by [Sam Tarakajian](http://www.otherbirds.com/about) with [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max/).\r\n\r\n[@oscillodome](https://github.com/oscillodome) 2015\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
